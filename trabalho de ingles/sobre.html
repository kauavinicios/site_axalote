            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>
               Axolotl, also known as "water monsters", are rather peculiar amphibians.
               Starting with the fact that they always live in dark and freshwater environments,
               possess three pairs of external gills and have high regenerative capacity.
               In addition, they spend all or almost all of their lives in the larval stage,
               although they are capable of reproduction - this modality is called neoteny.
               <br>
               These animals endemic to Mexico, approximately 25 centimeters in length,
               They feed on tadpoles and small invertebrates such as insects, crustaceans and earthworms.
               They can live for approximately twelve years, reproducing about twelve months after birth,
               between June and December; or in captivity, when a sudden decrease in temperature is promoted.
               <br>
               The male deposits his sperm in a pouch, which is collected by the female,
               through its cloacal opening. Approximately one day after this event,
               it spawns on rocks and/or leaves. The larvae hatch about two weeks later,
               and are about one centimeter long.
               <br>
               Due to its ability to regenerate, including regions of the nervous system or even entire limbs,
               Axolotl is extensively studied by several researchers,
               being the hope of those who have had limbs amputated or tissue loss from other regions of the body.
            </p>
         </div>
         
         <div class="row d_flex">   
            <div class="sobre-1 col-md-6">
               <h2 id="black">Habitat</h2>
               <p>
                  Unlike their close relatives, such as toads and frogs,
                  that start to live on land when they leave the larval forms,
                  Axolotls remain in the water for life.
                  <br>
                  Its only natural habitat consists of the lakes near Mexico City,
                  in particular Lake Xochimilco and Lake Chignahuapan,
                  the latter in the state of Puebla. Currently, in Lake Chignahuapan,
                  are rarely found. This is due to the predation of their eggs by non-native species introduced by humans.
                  In addition, the Axolotl's ability to regenerate also brings some problems,
                  since in certain areas of Mexico it is appreciated in broths and for naturist medicine (as a vitamin).
                  <br>
                  Due to human invasion in the region of these lakes and the drainage of some areas of it,
                  the axolotl's habitat has declined.
                  The pollution brought by tourism in the region caused a decrease in the population of these animals,
                  as they are very sensitive.
                  Today they are mostly found in breeding sites for the maintenance and preservation of the species.

            <h2>Healing</h2>
            <p>
               The Axolotl is able to regenerate, through cellular dedifferentiation, entire limbs,
               that are made up of structures not commonly regenerated, such as nerves,
               musculature, bones and blood vessels.
               It is even capable of completely repairing half of your heart or brain.
               Such properties are often analyzed in the laboratory.

            <h2>Conservation status</h2>
            <p>
               The axolotl lives a sad reality: its days are numbered.
               In the first census carried out in 1998, 6,000 specimens per square kilometer were found in the canals;
               in 2003, the population dropped to 1,000 per square kilometer;
               and in 2008, only 100 specimens were found in the same perimeter, according to the Mexican Academy of Sciences.
            </p>
            <p>
               With the intention of contributing to the conservation of the environment,
               the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco)
               proclaimed the chinampas of Xochimilco (small lands, formerly floating,
               where flowers and vegetables are grown) World Heritage Site in 1987.
               Recognition is threatened due to the worsening of its condition caused by the advance of urbanization.
               The canal region, moreover, is a recreational area largely covered by tourist boats.
            </p>
            <p>
               There are 17 different species and the decrease in population is due to the runoff of wastewater into the canals,
               building houses and introducing species such as carp and tilapia, which eat axolotls.
               "The predatory species were introduced by humans for sport fishing.
               Just two couples are enough, because they can lay approximately 300 eggs.
               The population of that region knows that they shouldn't do that, but in this way they help tourists to go,
               which represents an inflow of money", assures the biologist Raúl Rivera Velázquez,
               from the Faculty of Higher Studies Iztacala at UNAM.
               The specialist has been working with these animals for six years.
               "Their skin is very permeable. Any toxin can affect them. That's why there are no more specimens in Lake Xochimilco,
               because the waters were contaminated".
               In this sense, axolotls are very delicate and anyone working with them must strictly adhere to strict hygiene measures:
               "Our grease, creams or food residue on our hands can clog their pores and kill them,"
               says Jesús Correa, a young man under 30 who directs A Casinha do Axolotle,
               one of the 20 centers dedicated to the reproduction of the animal in the surroundings of Xochimilco.
            </p>
            <figure class="text-center"><img class="rounded" style="width: 500px;" src="images/axalote_triste.png" alt="#"/></figure>
            <p>
               In addition to the loss of the ecosystem, with contaminated water, and the introduction of predatory species into the waters,
               Correa believes that the change in production activity in the region contributed to the worsening of conditions in Xochimilco.
               "Before, only vegetables were grown in lakes. Now ornamental plants are planted in different lands.
               At the same time, chemicals and pesticides are applied and these run down the canals, killing the animals."
            </p>

            <p>
               "There is a contradiction between tourism,
               the population growth in the surroundings of Xochimilco and the damage that all this causes to the environment",
               says the director of the ecological park, Erwin Stephan Otton,
               who admits not being able to give an exact figure for the number of axolotls that are still left,
               because it is difficult to count them.
            </p>
            
            <p>
               "There are many centers that are dedicated to axolotl breeding.
               Most are in excellent condition and have a large quantity",
               explains Jesús Correa. "The creation of captivity is being implemented within the places destined for chinampas.
               The solution involves restoring the channels and creating a semi-natural habitat for axolotls,
               so that they no longer live in closed tanks. Now, efforts are being made to remove the species from the threat of extinction.
               Then these uses can be authorized."
            </p>

            <p>
               In the past, the axolotl was used in medicine to fight respiratory problems and child malnutrition,
               and also as food in some typical dishes of Mexican cuisine.
               "Now the trade in axolotls for these purposes is prohibited.
               As a result, its price on the black market increased:
               a two-year-old couple can cost between 2,000 and 2,500 pesos (between U$100 and U$150 USD)".
            </p>

            <p>
               The caretaker acknowledges that once, as a child, he tasted axolotl meat.
               Today he comments that he could not: "You gain affection with time". Like the man in Cortazar's tale,
               that he is obsessed with trying to find out what kind of suffering will accompany this species,
               Jesús Correa looks at the aquariums: "I really don't know. Maybe they are aware that we have them here to preserve them,
               because they are the last ones, or maybe they think that we only store them for taste", he reflects, before ending the interview.
               As Cortázar said, axolotls are not animals.
